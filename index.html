  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: 16 February 2026</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>HoustiApps</strong> ("we", "us", or "our")
    handles information when you use our mobile applications, including
    <strong>WAI Grid</strong> and <strong>WAB Grid</strong> (the "Apps").
  </p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not collect or store personal data on external servers.</li>
    <li>We do not sell, rent, or share personal information.</li>
    <li>All app data is stored locally on your device unless explicitly exported by you.</li>
    <li>You can contact us at <a href="mailto:houstiapps@gmail.com">houstiapps@gmail.com</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Information We Process</h2>

  <h3>1. Data You Enter</h3>
  <p>
    The Apps may allow you to enter information such as callsigns, grid references,
    notes, or logging information. This information is stored locally on your device
    and is not transmitted to us.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Location Information</h3>
  <p>
    The Apps may request access to your device location in order to calculate and
    display grid references. Location data is processed on your device only and is
    not stored, transmitted, or shared with HoustiApps.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may disable location access at any time in your device settings.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Device Permissions</h3>
  <p>
    The Apps may request certain permissions (such as location access) strictly
    for core functionality. No background tracking or continuous monitoring occurs.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>
    All data created or entered within the Apps is stored locally on your device.
    We do not operate servers that collect or store user data.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The Apps do not use third-party analytics, advertising frameworks, or external
    tracking services.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the Apps use platform services provided by Apple or Google (such as app
    distribution or crash reporting), those services operate under their own
    privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The Apps are not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect
    personal information from children.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>
    Because we do not collect or store personal data, we do not retain information
    that can be accessed, corrected, or deleted by us. You may delete all app data
    by removing the Apps from your device.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted on
    this page with a revised "Last updated" date.
  </p>
